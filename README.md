# UART
UART communication between FPGA and Computer

Hello, My Name Is Ibrahim AYAZ, and in this project, I will be showing you the UART communication between computer and FPGA. 
I used Digilent's Nexys 4DDR board in this project. At the end of the design, I will be reflecting the Hexadecimal value of a key pressed on the keyboard on the Seven Segment display using the Tera Term program on the computer. 
The key pressed on the keyboard will be displayed by the Receiver on the Seven Segment display, then will be sent by the Transmitter to the Tera Term, and which key on the keyboard is pressed will be reflected on the TERA Term's screen.
